## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

The website is built entirely with vanilla web technologies:

**Frontend Structure**

- HTML5 for semantic document structure
- CSS3 for visual styling and layout design
- Pure CSS animations and transitions

**Layout Methodology**

## Notable Features

**Dynamic Theme System**
The site includes a custom-built dark/light mode toggle that switches the entire color scheme without JavaScript, utilizing pure CSS and the checkbox state technique.

**Responsive Layout**
Carefully crafted media queries ensure the portfolio displays correctly across all device sizes - from smartphones to desktops.

**Interactive Elements**

- Floating profile image with CSS keyframe animation
- Smooth hover effects on interactive components
- Direct PDF resume download capability
- Functional contact form with backend integration

**Visual Design**

- Clean, minimalist interface
- Strategic use of whitespace
- Color-coded skill tags
- Organized project timeline
